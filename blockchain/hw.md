2. Why do you like it? Potential benefits?

The idea of a decentralized internet means no (or very difficult-to-accomplish) censorship. As the article states, the main method of taking down a domain requires taking down every computer that participates in the blockchain. It's essentially a digital version of the mob, where particpants find strength in numbers. It's impractical and thus unreasonable to try to take down every computer that participates in a huge blockchain. For sites that are generally accepted and deemed unnecessary of censorship, this is obviously a win.

3. Potential problems?

The problem comes when a website, i.e. one on "the dark web" becomes impossible to take down. Most people would probably agree that illegal websites containing trafficking and other elicit behaviors should be taken down, but a blockchain-based decentralized hosting option makes it much more difficult to censor when there are enough backers. 

### Other considerations

I am also wondering how this would practically function, given many sites serve more than static content, i.e. HTML/CSS/JS content. What about most web applications that utilize a backend server, i.e. Python, Java, Firebase, etc? Is it possible to decentralize that content? 

And what about maintenance? When the developers update their content, does the decentralized nature require updating files in hundreds, thousands, or more places? These are all important questions when considering a decentralized internet.
